            To keep your jewelry looking its best, store it in a dry, cool place
            away from direct sunlight. Clean regularly with a soft cloth and
            avoid contact with harsh chemicals, perfumes, and lotions. For
            pieces with gemstones, use a gentle soap and water solution.
